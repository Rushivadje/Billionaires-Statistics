# Billionaire Statistics Data Analysis Project
# Project Overview
The Billionaire Statistics Data Analysis Project aims to uncover key insights from a dataset of billionaires, including their demographics, wealth distribution, and categories of wealth sources. This project explores trends and characteristics among billionaires worldwide, shedding light on self-made versus inherited fortunes and highlighting key countries and industries with high concentrations of wealth.

# Problem Statement
The analysis addresses questions such as:

    What are the most common industries among billionaires?
    How does wealth distribution vary between self-made and inherited billionaires?
    What are the significant age and gender demographics?
    Which countries host the highest number of billionaires?

# Motivation
Understanding the patterns and distribution of global wealth is crucial for gaining insights into economic disparities, investment opportunities, and the factors that contribute to extreme financial success. This analysis aims to shed light on these patterns and inform discussions about wealth accumulation and global economic dynamics.

# Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 2,640 records and 35 columns, detailing attributes like:

    Demographics: Age, gender, country, and city.
    Financial Information: Final net worth and wealth source.
    Education and Economy: GDP, life expectancy, and education enrollment of respective countries.
    Key Data Cleaning and Imputation Techniques
    Age: Imputed missing values with the mean age (65.14) to maintain consistency in analysis.
    Organization & Title: Columns with high missing values were noted but not imputed due to irrelevance for the primary analysis.
    Geographic Information: Filled missing country-related metrics where possible, emphasizing economic attributes like GDP and life expectancy.
